            Canada</a></dt>
    <dd>This figure shows the employment change relative fo February 2020 for selected groups of sectors in Canada. The
        impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic were not evenly spread across the economy; job losses were concentrated in
        high-contact sectors. Particularly hard hit were businesses in accommodation and food service; information,
        culture, and recreation; and "other" services, which includes businesses such as physiotherapy, nail
        salons, and hairdresses.</dd>
    <dt><a href="employment_change _skills.html">Employment in occupations typically requiring university degree least
            impacted by COVID-19</a></dt>
    <dd>This figure shows how uneven the recovery was across occupationsl skill levels. Employment in occupations
        that typically require a university degree (NOC "skill level" A) grew steadily through 2020 and 2021, and was
        11.7% higher in February 2022 relative to February 2020.</dd>

    <dd>This figure illustrates the relative change in employment by province and territory in Canada, from February
        2020 to April 2020 and from April 2020 to February 2022. Labour markets across Canda rebounded quickly from the
        initial lockdown, which began to ease in May 2020, but recovery was not smooth or universal across sectors and
        jusidictions. As of February 2020, employment had recovered in nearly all provinces and territories, with
        employment in New Brunswick just slightly below where it was in February 2020 (-0.8%). The strongest recoveries
        apart from the territories occured in British Columbia (+3.2%), Ontario (+2.6%), and Prince Edward Island
        (+2.6%). </dd>
