                <p><em>Economist, Teacher, Data Analyst, and Web Developer wannabe</em></p>
                <p>I am an experienced data analyst with master's degrees in Economics and Education. I specialize in
                    extracting valuable insights and recommendations from complex data sets, and have worked across
                    multiple sectors, including labour market analytics, health care, and education. I am skilled in
                    exploring new technologies for data analysis and committed to helping organizations make informed
                    decisions based on data-driven insights.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy indulging in British comedies, fantasy novels, and fiber arts.</p>
